Bob Marley & The Wailers,"No Woman, No Cry","No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry

'Cause, 'cause, 'cause I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites, yeah
Mingle with the good people we meet, yeah
Good friends we have had, oh good friends we've lost along the way, yeah
In this bright future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say, yeah

No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, eh, yeah
Little darling don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

Eh, Said, said, said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown, yeah
And then Georgie would make the fire light, I say
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge, I say
Of which I'll share with you, yeah
My feet is my only carriage
And so I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright
So No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, I say
Oh little, oh little darling, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry, eh

No woman, no woman, no woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
One more time I've got to say
Oh little, little darling, please don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry"
Bob Marley & The Wailers,Redemption Song,"Old pirates, yes, they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Ooh, some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
Redemption songs


Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Whoa! Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them-ah can-ah stop-ah the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Yes, some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs

All I ever have
Redemption songs
These songs of freedom
Songs of freedom"

Bob Marley & The Wailers,Could You Be Loved,"Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved and be loved?

Don't let them fool ya
Or even try to school ya!
Oh, no!
We've got a mind of our own
So go to hell if what you're thinking isn't
Right!
Love would never leave us alone
A-yin the darkness there must come out to light

Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo yeah! - and be loved?

The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too
So while you point your fingers someone else is judging you

Bob Marley & The Wailers,Buffalo Soldier,"Buffalo soldier, dreadlocked rasta
There was a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
I mean it, when I analyse the stench
To me it makes a lot of sense
How the dreadlocked rasta was a Buffalo Soldier

And he was taken from Africa, brought to America
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said it was a Buffalo Soldier, dreadlocked Rasta
Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America

If you know your history
Then you would know where you're coming from
Then you wouldn't have to ask me
Who the 'eck do I think I am

I'm just a Buffalo Soldier in the heart of America
Stolen from Africa, brought to America
Said he was fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier, win the war for America
Said he, woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!
Woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!

Buffalo Soldier troddin' through the land, wo-ho-ooh!
Said he want to ran and then you want a hand
Troddin' through the land, yea-hea, yea-ea
Said he was a Buffalo Soldier in the war for America
Buffalo Soldier, dreadlocked Rasta
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Driven from the mainland to the heart of the Caribbean
Said he, woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!
Woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!

Trodding through San Juan
In the arms of America
Trodding through Jamaica, a Buffalo Soldier
Fighting on arrival, fighting for survival
Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock rasta
Woy yoy yoy, woy yoy-yoy yoy
Woy yoy yoy yoy, yoy yoy-yoy yoy!"

Bob Marley & The Wailers,War,"Until the philosophy which hold one race
Superior and another Inferior
Is finally
And permanently
Discredited
And abandoned
Everywhere is war
Me say war

That until there are no longer
First-class and second-class citizens of any nation
Until the colour of a man's skin
Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes
Me say war

That until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
Dis a war

That until that day
The dream of lasting peace
World citizenship
Rule of international morality
Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued
But never attained
Now everywhere is war
War

And until the ignoble and unhappy regime
That hold our brothers in Angola
In Mozambique
South Africa
Sub-human bondage
Have been toppled
Utterly destroyed
Well, everywhere is war
Me say war

War in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south

War, war
Rumors of war
And until that day
The African continent
Will not know peace
We Africans will fight, we find it necessary
And we know we shall win
As we are confident
In the victory
Of good over evil

Good over evil, yeah!
Good over evil
Good over evil, yeah!
Good over evil
Good over evil, yeah!"
Bob Marley & The Wailers,Natural Mystic,"There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
If you listen carefully now you will hear

This could be the first trumpet, might as well be the last

I won't tell no lie

One and all got to face reality now
Though I've tried to find the answer to all the questions they ask
Though I know it's impossible to go living through the past
Don't tell no lie

These are the days when we'll trod through Babylon
We keep on trodding until Babylon falls!"
Bob Marley & The Wailers,I Know,"Wo, man, there you are!

When the race gets hard to run
It means you just can't take the pace
When it's time to have your fun
You find the tears run on down through your face
Then you stop and think a little
Are you the victim of the system?
Anyday now they gone let you down
Remember, Natty will be there
To see you through

(I)	And is it good to know (know) now
Jah will be waiting there
(I) won't it doggone good to know (know) , you all
Jah will be waiting there
Wait in Summer, wait in Spring
Wait in Autumn, Winter thing
(Tribe) goes up, all the tribe goes down
Bring my children from the end of the earth

Many a time I sit and wonder why
This race so - so very hard to run
Then I say to my soul: take courage
Battle to be won
Like a ship that's tossed and driven
Battered by the angry sea, yea-eah!
Say the tide of time was raging
Don't let the fury fall on me, no, no!

(I) Cause I know (know) -know
Jah will be waiting there
(I) Ain't it good to know (know) now

Bob Marley & The Wailers,Slogans,"Can't take your slogans no more
Can't take your slogans no more
Can't take your slogans no more
Can't take your slogans no more

Wipe out the paintings of slogans
All over the streets (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Confusing the people
While your asphalt burns our tired feet
I see borders and barriers
Segregation, demonstration and riots (ooh, ooh, ooh)
A-sufferation of the refugees
Oh-oh, when, when will we be free?

Oh-oh-oh, we can't take your slogans no more
Can't take your slogans no more
Can't take your slogans no more
No more sweet talk from-a grimepit
No more sweet talk from the hypocrites


So we know we can't take your slogans no more
Can't take your slogans no more
Can't take your slogans no more
No more sweet talk from-a pulpit
No more sweet talk from the pulpit

No more sweet talk from-a grimepit
No more sweet talk from the hypocrites (oh, no hypocrites!)
No more sweet talk from-a grimepit (wo-ah yeah)
No more sweet talk (no-no-no-no sweet talk) from the hypocrites (hey!)
No more sweet talk from-a grimepit
No more sweet talk (no-no-no-no sweet talk) from the hypocrites (no-no-no-no hey!)"
