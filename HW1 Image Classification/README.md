# homework-1

## Changelog
- v00: three convolutional layers, one dense layer as in the example from the 4th lab session
- v01: first basic model with two convolutional layers and one dense layer, no optimization of any sort
- v02: same network as v01, but with regularizaton
- v03: three convolutional layers, one dense layer, no optimization
- v04: same network as v03 with early stopping (to be tuned, the early stopping is not triggered)
- v05: same network as v04, this time with data augmentation
