<h1 align="center"> Image Classification and Time-Series Forecasting</h1>

*Developed with Domenico Cacace and Miguel Gonzalez under the group name **DMU**.*

## Description 

The repository contains two folders with projects and a folder with the notebooks from the lab exercise sessions. Check each project folder to get a broader description of the task. Each projects-related notebook was run on `Kaggle`, while the notebooks from the exercise sessions were run on `Colab`.


### [Plant Leaves Image Classification](Plant-Leaves-Image-Classification/)
In this homework you are required to classify images of leafs, which are divided into categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.

### [Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](Multivariate-Time-Series-Forecasting/)
In this homework, you are required to predict future samples of a multivariate time series. The goal is to design and implement forecasting models to learn how to exploit past observations in the input sequence to correctly predict the future.

### [Practical Sessions](Practical-Sessions/)
The folder consists on multiple notebooks covering a broad spectrum of topics, such as overfitting, convolutional neural networks, transfer learning, autoencoders, transformers, neural machine translation and etc.
